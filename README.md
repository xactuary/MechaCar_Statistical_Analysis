# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Background  
MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. This analysis will create a model to predict the mpg for each prototype.  
### Summary  
Statistical analysis 1 - multiple regression analysis to determine which input variables are most predictive of the prototype mpg.
